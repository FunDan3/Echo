CLI post quantum messager app. Probably doesnt have best security but I need to do it for my school project

Development plans (deleated upon compleation):
  -- no contributions to this phase please --
  registration/login system
  allow users to access each others public data
  messaging system
  -- contibution are welcome after this --
  more data collection because law enforcement migh demand that data (ip addresses that logged in, time of last login)
  account deletion
  data limitations (to not overload my or someone else's server)
  capcha's for registration
  User Interface (I have no idea how to do this myeslf so I would need many time to figure that out or rely on contributions)
